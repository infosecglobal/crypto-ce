## Description

AgileSec SDK is a universal cryptographic SDK written in C, with a view to implement cryptographic agility in applications. 
AgileSec SDK makes it possible to develop cryptography applications against a high-level cryptographic Agile API, while retaining the ability to swap the underlying implementations of cryptographic algorithms at runtime not only for newly developed but also for already developed and deployed applications.
